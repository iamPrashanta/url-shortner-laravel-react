npm install axios clsx



axios
A popular HTTP client for making API requests from JavaScript.

In your code, it’s used to send a POST request to your backend (/api/links) to create a short URL.

Without import axios, your axios.create(...) line will throw axios is not defined.

import axios from "axios";

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE,
});

await api.post("/api/links", payload);








clsx
A small utility to combine CSS class names conditionally.

In your code, it decides what Tailwind classes to apply based on whether the URL has been copied:

import clsx from "clsx";

<button
  className={clsx(
    "px-3 py-1.5 rounded-md text-sm border transition",
    copied
      ? "bg-emerald-500 text-white border-emerald-500"
      : "bg-white text-slate-700 border-slate-200 hover:border-slate-300"
  )}
>
If you don’t import clsx, React will crash with clsx is not defined.
